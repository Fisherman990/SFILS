# Findings

This folder contains our findings from this database project.

The findings include details about the library patrons. For example, how many from the age range 0 to 9 years used the library, how many of them were repeat patrons (can be found from total checkouts), how many renewed (can be found from total renewals).

# Performance Metrics

This folder also contains the performance values.

Did we store the data in our database appropriately?

This is meant to be a more manageable database with multiple tables. We are not simply dumping the whole Excel sheet into one giant MySQL table.
